1. Whitespaces are allowed in first name and last name
Example:     y (starting whitespaces should be removed automatically)

2. User should be provided to edit email address. If user has entered wrong email and proceeds, 
there's no other ways to change email id and hence user will not be able to proceed further.
It completly blocks the user with the popup saying "Please verify your email ID to continue. etc"

3. Cancel button or back button should be introduced in the popups

4. Getting same OTP twice. OTP should always be different.

5. Proper message is not shown when user enters invalid OTP

6. Not receiving OTP in email, hence user will not be able to explore the app. Its blocking in the home page itself.

7. No option to go back from OTP page or any other pages. If the user wants to login with gmail, he cannot go back and do nothing.

8. If the app is closed and reopened, then page still lands on otp page (Blocker)
